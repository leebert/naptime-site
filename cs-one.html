                <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Guy's a pro. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
                <h3>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun.</h3>

                <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. That's why you always leave a note! First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>
                <p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I'm afraid I just blue myself. I've opened a door here that I regret. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>

                <p>Army had half a day. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Steve Holt! I'm afraid I just blue myself. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</p>
                <p>Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</p>
